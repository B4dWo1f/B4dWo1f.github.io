I have always had a love/hate relation with [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). On one hand I think it is awesome and it opens a whole universe of possibilities. On the other hand, I am terrible at electronics and even lighting a LED is a challenge for me.

Anyhow, I always wanted to have a motorized webcam so I can move around and still be in the frame. So this project contains the first steps towards that goal.
